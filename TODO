* Make pseudo-functions (eval, print, etc) have same call syntax as actual functions
* Add literal hashes
* Need some kind of runtime error support
   Also, stop throwing every piece of error information out to stderr.
* Create FFI / start writing standard libraries
* Add splat arguments to functions/macros
* Variable scope is currently leaky, needs to be updated.
